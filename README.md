 Introduction:
The Employee Salary Calculator is a C++ program designed to automate the process of calculating and displaying the salary details of an employee based on various input parameters such as hourly rate, hours worked per day, work days, bonus percentage, and employee position. This program streamlines the task of payroll processing and provides a clear overview of an employee's compensation.

 Description:
The program utilizes a class named "Employee" to encapsulate the attributes and methods related to an employee's salary calculation and display. The private members of the class include the employee's name, ID, hourly rate, hours worked per day, work days, salary, bonus, and position. The class provides methods to input employee details, calculate salary, and display the salary details.

 Project Steps:
1. Input Employee Details:
   - The program prompts the user to input essential details such as employee name, ID, hourly rate, hours worked per day, work days, bonus percentage, and position.

2. Calculate Salary:
   - The program calculates the employee's salary based on the entered hourly rate, hours worked per day, and work days.
   - It also calculates the bonus amount based on the provided bonus percentage and adds it to the salary.

3. Display Details:
   - The program displays a comprehensive set of details related to the employee, including name, ID, position, hourly rate, hours worked per day, work days, base salary, bonus percentage, bonus amount, and total salary.

 Advantages:
- Automation: The program automates the salary calculation process, reducing manual errors and saving time.
- Transparency: Provides a transparent breakdown of the employee's salary components, making it easy for both employees and employers to understand.

 Benefits:
- Efficiency: Streamlines the payroll process, making it more efficient and less prone to errors.
- Clarity: Offers a clear and detailed view of the salary structure, fostering transparency and trust.

 Conclusion:
The Employee Salary Calculator is a valuable tool for businesses to manage payroll efficiently and maintain transparency in salary structures. By automating the calculation and display of employee salaries, the program contributes to error reduction and facilitates a clearer understanding of compensation components. This project can be further extended to include additional features and integrations for comprehensive payroll management.
